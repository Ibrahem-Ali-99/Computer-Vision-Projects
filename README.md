# Computer-Vision-Projects

A collection of computer vision projects implemented using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. This repository showcases various techniques and applications in computer vision.

## Projects

### Fourier Transform Filters
- **Description**: Demonstrates image filtering techniques using Fourier Transforms (e.g., ideal, butterworth, gaussian filters).
- **Notebook**: [Fourier_Transform_Filters.ipynb](https://github.com/Ibrahem-Ali-99/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/main/Fourier_Transform_Filters.ipynb)
- **Details**: Explore low-pass and high-pass filtering with detailed visualizations.

### Morphological Operations
- **Description**: Implements morphological operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing on images.
- **Notebook**: [Morphological_Operations.ipynb](https://github.com/Ibrahem-Ali-99/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/main/Morphological_Operations.ipynb)
- **Details**: Includes examples and visualizations of morphological transformations.

### SIFT Project
- **Description**: Explores Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for feature detection and matching.
- **Notebook**: [SIFT_Project.ipynb](https://github.com/Ibrahem-Ali-99/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/main/SIFT%20Project.ipynb)
- **Details**: Contains code and results for SIFT-based image processing.

### Object Tracking
- **Description**: Contains projects and resources for object tracking in video streams, including a YOLO comparison.
